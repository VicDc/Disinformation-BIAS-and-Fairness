# Disinformation-BIAS-and-Fairness

🚨 Disinformation, Bias & Fairness – A Data-Driven Dive 🧠📊

Just wrapped up an exciting notebook that analyzes bias and fairness in online content, using a real YouTube interview transcription as the dataset. Here’s a peek into what it does: 👇

🔍 What’s inside the notebook?

📄 Parses PDF text of an interview with BarbascuraX, a popular Italian science communicator

🧠 Identifies conspiratorial language and institutional references in the dialogue

⚖️ Detects signs of bias and imbalance in how themes are presented

🧮 Uses keyword frequency and semantic patterns to highlight problematic narratives

📈 Visualizes the spread of references, bias markers, and unfair assumptions

💡 This kind of analysis helps us understand how information is framed—and more importantly, how subtle biases influence our perception.

📚 Built with:

Python 🐍

PyPDF2 & FPDF for document processing

Semantic and frequency-based techniques for analysis

🔁 Why it matters:
Understanding bias and fairness is critical in today’s world of information overload and AI-generated content. This notebook is a step toward transparent, responsible data science.
